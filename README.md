### TODOs

##### page flickering

**problem:** user open link in new tab, tab loads in bg. captureVisibleTab only works w/ active tab. currently written to activate other tab, snap, and switch back to old tab, causes a flicker as it switches

**solution:** throw into queue, wait until user focuses into tab. use listeners to delete from queue if user does not look at tab.
